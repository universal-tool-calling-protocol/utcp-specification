# About Us

The Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP) is a fully open source project with the goal of being entirely community driven. We aim to create a modern, flexible, and scalable standard for defining and interacting with tools across various communication protocols.

## Our Vision

UTCP was established to provide a standardized way for systems to discover, document, and execute tools across different platforms and protocols. Our vision is to create a vibrant ecosystem where the community continues to drive innovation and development.

## Community-Driven Development

We believe in the power of open source collaboration. This project thrives on contributions from developers, researchers, and organizations who share our goal of creating a universal standard for tool calling. Everyone is welcome to participate, contribute, and help shape the future of UTCP.
